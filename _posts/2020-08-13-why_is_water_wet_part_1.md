title: Why is water wet?
---

Up to 60% of the adult human body is made up of water. Around 71% of the surface of the earth is covered by water. It goes without saying that water is all around us and acts as an essential constituent of most of life on planet earth. Weâ€™ve grown up with knowing all about using water in our everyday lives. But thoughts may be bugging you about some properties of the liquid that we call water. Particularly, is water wet?

### Wetness
Dictionary definitions for wetness do not give us much insight into whether wetness is a property of the liquid or whether it is something else. More likely, it is the common expression of several fundamental scientific processes at work that produce the effect of wetness. Let us take a closer look.

When we say something is wet or has been wetted, we mean that some liquid, usually water, is present on the surface of a solid object. This could be a towel, your finger or the page of a book. 

### Molecular Bonding
Elements are made up of atoms. Each atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons orbiting the nucleus in various orbits called shells. The nucleus has net positive charge due to the protons and neutral neutrons that it is made of. Electrons are negatively charged. Usually, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, and thus, the atom is electrically neutral.

However, electrons in the outer shells of some atoms tend to break free and they find a new home in some atom of another element. This leads to the formation of what are called ions, which is a fancy way of saying that the atom has net charge which is not neutral. (One electron leaves the atom making it positively charged and the atom which absorbs the free electron becomes negatively charged). Thus, there can be an attractive force between these ions and ionic bonds are formed. Another way for atoms to come together is by sharing electrons with each other. This leads to the formation of covalent bonds which are much stronger than ionic bonds.
What happens when one of the atoms forming a covalent bond pulls the electron slightly more towards it? The net charge on one side of the molecule differs from the net charge at another end of the molecule. These are called polar molecules and water is a fine example of such a molecule.

### Water as an example
Let us study how water is formed from Hydrogen and Oxygen atoms.

In water, two hydrogen and one oxygen atom form covalent bonds and polarity of the molecule is introduced because the oxygen atom pulls the electrons slightly more towards itself. This makes the oxygen side of the atom slightly electronegative and the hydrogen sides of the atom slightly electropositive.
What happens when there are many water molecules near each other? The polarity of the water molecules induces them to form what are called Hydrogen bonds among themselves. Thus, the hydrogen atom from one water molecule, the donor, forms a bond with the electronegative oxygen atom of another water molecule, which is called the acceptor.
