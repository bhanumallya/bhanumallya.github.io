title: What is the purpose of life?
---

Life procreates itself. From the smallest cells to the largest animals and vegetation, this has been the way of the world for billions of years. But intelligent life seeks purpose in everything. Why? Why? Why? Perhaps it is time to stop asking that question and just be.

Any action that is greater than the self, places itself as an answer to the question of purpose. If there is no Karma, no soul, and no divine power, then the purpose of life is simply to have consequences that are larger than the single self. Whether this builds positively or negatively, most of the cases will be positive and thus the species progresses.

All life has consequences larger than the self. Should a human life be attributed to such a small goal? Absolutely not! The purpose of a human self should be the seeking out of knowledge, of learning and further fueling the fire of intelligence that has evolved in them over millennia. For it is in this memory, where knowledge is stored, does the human mind become one with the world and the consequences of that outstrip anything else in the natural world.

To be aware of existence, to be conscious of one’s presence and of one’s consequences is a rare gift that we are unable to find a similar awareness in the darkest reaches of the cosmos. It is through the experience of thought that we define our existence and our thoughts are only as rich as our experience, our experience only as rich as our knowledge and our knowledge only as rich as our sense of purpose and our awareness of our consequences.
