title: How to become a great software developer
---

Those new to the world of software development may find things a little unstructured. There are thousands of technologies, hundreds of frameworks, dozens of programming languages, and libraries. Now, you weave in and out of all this mess and gather a little experience along the way. Slowly, you figure out what fits with what and the jargon assembles into neat compartments.

The art of Software Engineering has grown tremendously over the last decade. With systems at scale serving billions of users, DevOps has become a job title in itself. Just writing code doesn’t cut it anymore and a great software developer is expected to know how to scale the system.

With that said, say you were tasked with or have picked up a problem that requires you to produce software infrastructure as an output. There would be the following sequence of execution items:

+ a)	Understand the domain.
+ b)	Understand the context in which the problem arises.
+ c)	Solve the problem.
+ d)	Publish your results.

Let us take a closer look at what each step requires you to do:

### Understand the domain
Every area of human activity has its own set of nuances and protocols. One needs to make sure that at least at a high level, these are known to you.

### Understand the context in which the problem arises
Problems usually occur due to a gap between what is available and what is needed. They are usually reported by some people or spotted as an opportunity by an entrepreneur. Usually, one need not know the entire domain in order to solve a problem, but it is just enough to understand the how, what, when, where and why of the problem.

### Solve the problem
If a problem is to be solved using software, you would again have to make certain trade-offs:

+ a)	What platform is most suitable for this problem?
+ b)	What tools and languages will you be using?
+ c)	Design, code, test, and iterate?
+ d)	How will you ensure security and privacy while solving the problem?

I will not be going into the details in this post.

### Publish your results
Whether you choose to monetize your solution or not, care must be taken that the customer gets a finished product with no obvious glitches.

When you’re not working on any problem for a customer or your employer, the best way to keep your skills sharp is to always looks for ways to improve yourself. You could, for example:

+ a)	Keep abreast of the tech world by reading news, blogs, books, etc.
+ b)	Put it to work! Find some piece of tech that excites you and build a sample application with it.
+ c)	Build an online profile. This could be your own blog or portfolio.
+ d)	Participate in contests. These could be coding oriented or full – blown software development hackathons.
