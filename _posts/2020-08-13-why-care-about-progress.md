title: Why care about progress?
---

Progress is a double-edged sword. We always eventually cast away a certain system, a way of life for many, to make way for the new. This process creates new opportunities while those who cannot cope with the changes are left behind to deal with regret and a helpless feeling of having no control.

We measure progress on different scales. There is the species level, where differing rates of progress have created a gap between the first world and the third. Then there are levels such as an individual country’s growth rate, and we could go deeper into states, corporations, projects to the progress made by an individual on their tasks for the day.

Similarly, there is work, and then again there’s work that produces something so amazing, so uplifting that the human species cannot ever be the same again. Such is the case with pioneering pursuits of the human spirit. Examples can be the invention of money, written language, and the printing press; or more recently, the invention of the personal computer and its incarnation into ever smaller form factors, such as smartphones.

There is something to be said for the simplicity of life one could enjoy when the world was less connected. But progress got in the way. Today, we are a planetary civilization, as evidenced by nothing less than a pandemic that has affected every country on Earth. Humanity has always sought to grow its domain of existence, from tribal clans to organized cities and nations. And we look to the stars to continue our journey of existence, living ever more exciting and eventful lives, unlocking the mysteries of nature, and building ever more sophisticated engineered dreams on the way.
